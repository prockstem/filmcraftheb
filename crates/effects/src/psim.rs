//! Pluggable particle simulation (GPU particles, M12.7).
//!
//! The stepped particle systems (CC Particle World, CC Particle Systems II and Particle
//! Playground's Cannon without interacting forces) evolve every particle independently: births
//! come from a rate (the same `carry` arithmetic as the CPU step), and each particle integrates
//! its own motion with the same fixed step. An accelerator ([`ParticleSim`], reached through
//! [`crate::EffectHost::particles`]) can therefore simulate all of them in parallel and return
//! the state the CPU's `SimCache` would reach. The CPU stays the oracle: anything the backend
//! declines (interacting forces, caps that would drop births) simulates on the CPU.

/// CC Particle World / CC Particle Systems II physics (see `sim::Phys`), with the per-step and
/// per-spawn constants already evaluated on the CPU (bit-identical to the CPU's).
