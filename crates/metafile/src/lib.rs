//! Windows metafiles: hand-written EMF and WMF writers and readers.
//!
//! [`export`] writes the visible art over one region of a document (an artboard) as a metafile:
//!
//! - **EMF**: paths keep their Bézier curves, fills are solid brushes, strokes geometric pens with
//!   their width, caps, joins, miter limit and dashes; strokes a pen can't draw (aligned inside or
//!   outside, width profiles, arrowheads) are their filled outlines and brush strokes their brush
//!   art. Clipping masks clip, type is written as glyph outlines, images keep their pixels (with
//!   their transparency), gradients become images clipped to what they paint and pattern fills
//!   their tiles clipped to the shape. The header's frame is the region in 0.01 mm.
//! - **WMF**: the same art with curves flattened into polygons and 16-bit coordinates, behind a
//!   placeable header that gives the size; WMF has no clipping paths, transparency, dashes on wide
//!   lines or gradients, so clipped art is written whole, images over white, dashes as separate
//!   lines and gradients and patterns as one colour (each loss comes back as a warning).
//!
//! [`import`] reads either format back into a document of one artboard (the picture's frame) and
//! one layer: paths with fills and strokes, clipping, images and text. Records it doesn't read are
//! skipped, with one warning.
//!
//! - `bytes`: little-endian writing and bounds-checked reading.
//! - `dib`: device-independent bitmaps, both ways.
//! - `scene`: the document walk both writers share.
//! - `emf`, `wmf`: the writers.
//! - `import`: the reader.
