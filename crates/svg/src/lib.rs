//! VectorCraft SVG import and export.
//!
//! * [`export`] / [`export_full`] write a [`Document`] as SVG 1.1 with our own writer, as set by
//!   [`ExportOptions`] (presentation attributes, inline styles, style entities or internal CSS
//!   classes; gradients in `<defs>` with `userSpaceOnUse`; clip groups as `<clipPath>`; images
//!   embedded as `data:` URIs or linked; text as `<text>`/`<tspan>` or outlines; symbols as one
//!   `<symbol>` each with a `<use>` per instance; hidden layers left out, or kept not displayed),
//!   in UTF-8, UTF-16 or ISO 8859-1 ([`Output::bytes`]), as SVG 1.1 or a simplified SVG Tiny 1.2
//!   ([`Profile`]), optionally with the fonts type uses embedded as `@font-face` subsets.
//! * [`import`] / [`import_with_report`] parse SVG with `usvg` and convert its normalized tree into
//!   document nodes with all transforms baked into the geometry.
//! * [`css_rules`] writes the CSS web pages style objects with (the CSS Properties panel): shapes'
//!   paints as backgrounds and borders, type as fonts, shadows as `box-shadow`, each property
//!   written as SVG export writes it in its style sheets.
//!
//! ## Export approximations
//!
//! * **Stroke alignment** is not expressible in SVG 1.1. An *inside* stroke of a closed path is
//!   written as a stroke of double width clipped to the path's own shape (`<clipPath>`); an
//!   *outside* stroke as a stroke of double width masked by a `<mask>` that hides the path's
//!   interior. Both are visually exact but re-import as a group (clip group / masked stroke)
//!   rather than an aligned stroke. Open paths have no inside: their strokes are written centred,
//!   as the canvas draws them.
//! * **Arrowheads, width profiles, dashes fitted to corners and dotted dashes** are written as the
//!   filled outlines the canvas paints (the line and each arrowhead, grouped under the stroke's
//!   opacity); **brushed strokes** as their brush art. Both re-import as filled paths.
//! * **Multiple fills/strokes** (or per-fill/stroke blend modes) are written as a `<g>` holding one
//!   `<path>` per appearance item, in paint order.
//! * Live geometry effects are written as their result and raster effects (shadows, glows, blurs)
//!   as SVG filters.
//! * **Freeform gradients**, which SVG can't express, fill or stroke objects as an `<image>` of
//!   their colour field (sampled as the canvas samples it) clipped to the shape or the stroke's
//!   outline; on characters they are written as linear gradients. Gradients along or across
//!   strokes are written as slices of linear gradients clipped to the stroke.
//! * **Symbol instances** the shared `<symbol>` would paint differently from the canvas (stained,
//!   scaled with strokes, turned or scaled with effects, brushes or live objects, or holding
//!   pattern paints or unlinked masks, which stay on the page) are written as their own art.
//!
//! ## Import approximations
//!
//! * One CSS pixel (user unit) is one point, as on export, and absolute lengths (`in`, `cm`, `mm`,
//!   `pt`, `pc`) keep their physical size (72 pt per inch): `font-size="12pt"` is 12 pt. A root
//!   `width`/`height` in absolute units keeps its physical size, so a 210 mm SVG opens on a 210 mm
//!   artboard, its user units being CSS pixels of it (96 per inch). The document's units follow the
//!   unit of the root `width` (pixels when it has none).
//! * `<mask>` imports as a luminance opacity mask; a mask we exported keeps its options and art
//!   (its `data-vectorcraft-mask="noclip invert"` lists the options that differ from clipping and
//!   not inverted). Nested clip paths (`<clipPath clip-path>`) are clip groups in clip groups.
//! * Filters that are a Gaussian blur, a drop shadow (`feDropShadow` or the usual chains of offset,
//!   blur, flood or colour matrix, composite and merge), a glow or a feather (as we export them)
//!   become those live effects; other filters are ignored (reported as warnings).
//! * `<pattern>` becomes a pattern swatch (its content clipped to the tile) painted with the
//!   pattern's placement.
//! * `<symbol>` with `<use>` becomes a symbol and its instances. A `<use>` that shows the symbol
//!   differently (inherited paint, a viewport that cuts it) or that the canvas would paint
//!   differently (see the export's symbol rules) becomes plain art, as do `<use>`s of other
//!   elements.
//! * A `<g id>` layer (top-level, or inside one) that isn't displayed (`display: none`) comes back
//!   as a hidden layer; other undisplayed objects as hidden objects, unless a `<use>` refers to
//!   them.
//! * `spreadMethod` reflect and repeat are expanded into stops over the painted area (at most
//!   64 periods).
//! * `<image>` files are read through [`ImportOptions`]: rasters stay linked, SVG files (and SVG
//!   `data:` URLs) become art (without their text), missing ones a placeholder keeping the link.
//! * Text lines after the first start at the first line's x; text in a clip path is ignored;
//!   absolute positions inside type on a path are ignored; vertical text sets every glyph sideways.
//!
//! ## Import text
//!
//! usvg only keeps `<text>` when fonts are loaded; we don't load a font database (too expensive and
//! unavailable on wasm), so `<text>` elements are read from the XML as live [`TextObject`]s. Each
//! one is swapped for a placeholder before usvg runs, so the text keeps its z-order, parent group,
//! clip, mask, opacity, link, `<use>` instances and gradient or pattern paints. The style cascade
//! supports type, `#id`, `.class` (several), attribute, descendant and child selectors.
//! `<textPath>` becomes type on a path (`startOffset`, `side`), vertical `writing-mode` type on a
//! vertical path; per-character `x`/`y`/`dx`/`dy`/`rotate`, `baseline-shift`, numeric weights,
//! letter and word spacing become character attributes (line breaks, kerning, baseline shift,
//! rotation and style names).
