//! Lottie JSON import and export.
//!
//! Implemented from the public Lottie format description (the lottie-spec 1.0 schema and the
//! LottieFiles format documentation); no player or exporter source was used.
//!
//! **Export** ([`export_comp`]) turns a composition into a Lottie document: nested compositions
//! become precomp assets, still footage becomes embedded base64 image assets, and shape, solid,
//! null, precomp, image and text layers map to their Lottie layer types (text optionally as glyph
//! shapes). Transforms (with parenting, separated position and anchor), keyframes (temporal ease
//! converted from speed/influence to normalised Bezier `i`/`o` tangents, hold keys, spatial
//! `ti`/`to` tangents), shape contents, masks, track mattes, blend modes, time remapping, layer
//! timing and composition markers are exported. Anything Lottie cannot express (most effects,
//! cameras and lights, layer styles, audio, video footage…) is listed in
//! [`ExportResult::warnings`].
//!
//! **Import** ([`import`]) is the inverse mapping into a new composition.
//!
//! Keyframe times in Lottie are frames of the layer's local time, which is EffectCraft's layer
//! time; layer `ip`/`op`/`st` are composition frames and `sr` is the stretch factor.
