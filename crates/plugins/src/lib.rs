//! Sandboxed WebAssembly plug-ins for VectorCraft.
//!
//! A plug-in is a WebAssembly module that implements the VectorCraft plug-in ABI (v1, documented
//! in `docs/plugins.md`). It runs in [`wasmi`], a pure-Rust interpreter, with:
//!
//! - **no host imports**: no WASI, file system, network, clock or randomness. A module that
//!   imports anything is rejected;
//! - an **instruction budget** (fuel) per call, metered in slices so a wall-clock deadline is
//!   also enforced (native builds), so infinite loops end with an error;
//! - a **linear-memory cap**, a **recursion-depth cap** and wasmi's strict module limits;
//! - a **fresh instance per run**, so no state leaks between calls.
//!
//! Every failure (malformed module, trap, exhausted budget, bad output) is an [`Error`]; nothing
//! a module does can panic or hang the host.
//!
//! Plug-ins see the document as JSON ([`objects`]): the selected paths and compound paths with
//! their geometry, fills, strokes (gradients included) and opacity. An **object filter** returns
//! the objects to keep, change or add, applied to the document as one edit
//! ([`objects::apply_output`]); a **live effect** ([`effect`]) rewrites one object's geometry each
//! time it is drawn, from an appearance stack. The process-wide [`registry`] holds the installed
//! plug-ins.
